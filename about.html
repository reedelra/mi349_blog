        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name is Randall. I am a senior at Michigan State university
            majoring in information science. Although my journey at MSU is 
            coming to an end, there is even more work ahead as i enter into
            a new realm of creativity and self discover. This journey will
            not only be professional but also personal as i discover more 
            about myself and my own mental strength. I am also a veteran of the 
            US Army. I beleive that experience help me to be more resilient and
            to always go forward no matter the obstacles. Hopefully my future 
            post can encourage others to forge ahead on their own chosen paths
            no matter how difficult they may seem.
