        <p>For anyone curious enough to read this blog, i welcome you to embark
            on a journey through positive affirmations and positive thinking. Our
            minds are powerful tools, powerful enough to help us shape our reality.
            By viewing ourselves as one with the energies of the universe and not 
            apart from it, we can better position ourselves to harness those energies 
            and realize the power within ourselves. In an effort to not reduce this
            post to a rambling mess, I will dive deeper into metaphysics in future post.
            These future post will highlight different subjects and provide deeper insight 
            while not overwhelming myself and the reader with too much information upfront.

        <p>With this being my very first blog site, changes are to be expected. As we refine
            and expand on what we present, the reader can expect updates to the style of the 
            site from time to time. Images may change, as well as backgrounds. This will occur
            in order for us to explore different ways to present the site. I will be continously
            be looking for ways to improve and not rest on laurels. This site will of course maintain
            a consistent theme and style even though how those themes are represented msy be adjusted.
