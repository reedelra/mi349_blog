        <p>A Journey to Understanding Metaphysics</p>
        <time datetime="2024-10-12" title="October 12, 2024">Oct 12, 2024</time>
        <p>For anyone curious enough to read this blog, i welcome you to embark
            on a journey through positive affirmations and positive thinking. Our
            minds are powerful tools, powerful enough to help us shape our reality.
            By viewing ourselves as one with the energies of the universe and not 
            apart from it, we can better position ourselves to harness those energies 
            and realize the power within ourselves. In an effort to not reduce this
            post to a rambling mess, I will dive deeper into metaphysics in future post.
            These future post will highlight different subjects and provide deeper insight 
            while not overwhelming myself and the reader with too much information upfront.
        </p>

        <p>With this being my very first blog site, changes are to be expected. As we refine
            and expand on what we present, the reader can expect updates to the style of the 
            site from time to time. Images may change, as well as backgrounds. This will occur
            in order for us to explore different ways to present the site. I will be continously
            be looking for ways to improve and not rest on laurels. This site will of course maintain
            a consistent theme and style even though how those themes are represented msy be adjusted.

                <h2>Lunar Phases</h2>
                <p>The moon has eight total phases. These phases are the result of the changes
                    in the amount of light visible on the moon's surface. The sun illuminates
                    the moon's surface. These phases are the new moon, waxing crescent, first 
                    quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, wanning gibbous, last quarter and wanning crescent.

                <h2>New Moon</h2>
                <p>
                    The moon first phase or Lunar Phase is called the new moon. This 
                    phase occurs when the sun and the moon have the same ecliptic longitude.
                    This phase makes the moon look completely black 
                    because it is silhouetted against the sun (solar eclipse).

                <h2>Full Moon</h2>
                <p>
                    In this phase, the moon is fully illuminated in the night sky. During 
                    this phase the Earth is located between the the Sun and the Moon with
                    the side of facing Earth completed illuminated by the sun.
