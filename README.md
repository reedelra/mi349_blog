        <p>For anyone curious enough to read this blog, i welcome you to embark
            on a journey through positive affirmations and positive thinking. Our
            minds are powerful tools, powerful enough to help us shape our reality.
            By viewing ourselves as one with the energies of the universe and not 
            apart from it, we can better position ourselves to harness those energies 
            and realize the power within ourselves.
